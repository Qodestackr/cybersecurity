This one is hard because one must be familiar with Java programming to quickly identify the vulnerability. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `Java.Util.Random` class instead of `Java.Util.SecureRandom` class. The sessions generated by the Random class are weak and allow an attacker to predict future sessions IDs.
